	abstract = {There is consensus in the field of sustainability science that co-production of knowledge is needed to generate knowledge that is useful for addressing matters of concern. The field has made important advances, particularly focusing on developing strategies and principles that ensure the effective co-production of knowledge. Although these lay necessary foundations, less attention has been paid to the question as to what exactly is meant to “happen” in such processes. What is meant to happen, we argue, is that such processes generate knowledge that affects, by which we mean that it triggers an experiential intensity. Although affect ultimately underlies all kinds of knowledge (e.g., representational, such as discourse, or embodied, such as habits), different kinds and contents of knowledge affect (or not) participants of co-production processes in different ways. This paper thus argues that paying attention to affect in knowledge co-production increases the likelihood that it will be acted upon. To illustrate this point, we conceptualize knowledge as an assemblage generated through processes of knowledge co-production. We argue that for knowledge to affect, it must align the different kinds of knowledge mobilized in the process with the concrete experiences of those meant to act on it. In this paper, we particularly focus on the representational, discursive kind of knowledge, often of scientific nature, which continues to dominate processes of knowledge co-production, and explore alignment dynamics with the affective. In particular, we argue that applying methods and techniques that give room to the multimodal and multisensory nature of affect in co-production processes can support such alignment. We argue that the picture of knowledge co-production that emerges from our work as a potentially open-ended process of assembling is adequate for engaging with complex sustainability concerns in a world in constant becoming.},

ABSTRACT={The past two decades have seen an accumulation of theoretical and empirical evidence for the interlinkages between human health and well-being, biodiversity and ecosystem services, and agriculture. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the devastating impacts that an emerging pathogen, of animal origin, can have on human societies and economies. A number of scholars have called for the wider adoption of «One Health integrated approaches» to better prevent, and respond to, the threats of emerging zoonotic diseases. However, there are theoretical and practical challenges that have precluded the full development and practical implementation of this approach. Whilst integrated approaches to health are increasingly adopting a social-ecological system framework (SES), the lack of clarity in framing the key concept of resilience in health contexts remains a major barrier to its implementation by scientists and practitioners. We propose an operational framework, based on a trans-disciplinary definition of Socio-Ecological System Health (SESH) that explicitly links health and ecosystem management with the resilience of SES, and the adaptive capacity of the actors and agents within SES, to prevent and cope with emerging health and environmental risks. We focus on agricultural transitions that play a critical role in disease emergence and biodiversity conservation, to illustrate the proposed participatory framework to frame and co-design SESH interventions. Finally, we highlight critical changes that are needed from researchers, policy makers and donors, in order to engage communities and other stakeholders involved in the management of their own health and that of the underpinning ecosystems.}}

ABSTRACT={One Health (OH), EcoHealth (EH) and Planetary Health (PH) share an interest in  transdisciplinary efforts that bring together scientists, citizens, government and private sectors to implement contextualized actions that promote adaptive health management across human, animal and ecosystem interfaces. A key operational element underlying these Integrated Approaches to Health (IAH) is use of Systems Thinking as a set of tools for integration. In this paper we discuss the origins and epistemology of systems thinking and argue that participatory modelling, informed by both systems theory and expertise in facilitating engagement and social learning, can help ground IAH theoretically and support its development. Participatory modelling is iterative and adaptive, which is necessary to deal with complexity in practice. Participatory modelling (PM) methods actively involve affected interests and stakeholders to ground the field of inquiry in a specific social-ecological context. Furthermore, PM processes act to reconcile the diverse understandings of the empirical world that stem from divergent discipline and community viewpoints.
In this perspective article, we argue that PM can support systems thinking in practice and is essential for IAH implementation. Accordingly we invite PH, OH and EH practitioners to systematically incorporate specialists in systems science and social engagement and facilitation. This will enable the appropriate contextualization of research practice and interventions, and ensure a balanced representation of the roles and relationships of medical, biological, mathematical, and social disciplines. For completeness, funding schemes supporting IAH need to follow the same iterative, adaptive and participative processes to accompany IAH projects throughout their implementation.}}
