Sur la base de ces trois ressorts réflexifs, l’article présente une contribution à une géographie politique de l’environnement reconnue par sa capacité à se saisir des questions politiques de nature, son aptitude à se structurer comme pan de la discipline et sa possibilité à pouvoir apparaître libérée de toute forme de rattachements, tout autant orientés que bloquant son existence propre.},

	abstract = {Le développement durable et sa traduction en terme de participation des acteurs locaux aux choix d'avenir des territoires, dans lesquels ils vivent ou travaillent, sont devenus des sujets d'actualité. Mais le sens donné à ces deux termes développement durable est si variable et si controversé qu'un minimum de méthode s'impose pour mettre en place des démarches participatives autour de la gestion durable des ressources naturelles renouvelables. La modélisation d'accompagnement en est une parmi d'autres. Elle tire son originalité de l'implication récurrente des acteurs dans sa mise en oeuvre, du recours à des modèles comme moyens de représentation des enjeux en discussion et de l'importance donnée à l'interprétation collective des sorties de ces modèles. Cet ouvrage a pour objectif de familiariser le lecteur avec la démarche de modélisation d'accompagnement, en présentant la posture scientifique qui la fonde, ses méthodes et ses outils, et la place particulière des modèles. Il explique également comment intégrer plusieurs échelles de décision, prendre en compte les jeux de pouvoir, et enfin comment évaluer les effets de cette démarche sur les personnes associées à sa mise en oeuvre. Cet ouvrage s'appuie sur les exemples concrets issus de 27 cas étudiés par le collectif de chercheurs et sur des outils pédagogiques. Il est destiné aux chercheurs dans le domaine du développement rural et des ressources renouvelables, ainsi qu'aux étudiants et enseignants.},

	url = {https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00563236},
	abstract = {Participatory research relies on stakeholder inputs to obtain its acclaimed benefits of improved social relevance, validity, and actionability of research outcomes. We focus here on participatory research in the context of natural resource management. Participants' acceptance of participatory research processes is key to their implementation. Our first assumption is that this positive view and acceptance of participation in research processes is a public good for the whole participatory research community. We also assume that the diversity of participatory forms of research is rarely considered by potential participants when they make their decisions about whether or not to participate in a proposed process. We specifically address how to avoid stakeholders' reluctance to be involved in participatory research projects based on disillusion with past experiences. We argue that the disappointment experienced by stakeholders and other participants (i.e., researchers and policy makers) can be avoided by being upfront and precise about how participation will be implemented, and what kind of involvement is expected from participants. Such a collective effort from the research community can also clarify the variety of possible implementations for potential participants. Building on earlier efforts to characterize and categorize the diversity of participatory research approaches, we develop a conceptual analytic procedural framework to make participants' roles explicit in the implementation of different participatory research processes. This framework consists of three facets: (1) the flows of information among participants and the control over these flows for each step in a process, i.e., who will be expected to produce information, who will use this information, and who will receive the results; (2) the timing of the involvement of participants in the different steps of the research process, and the framing power that is associated with each process step; and (3) the organization of communication among participants for each information flow, i.e., in what configuration (bilaterally or as a group, mediated or face to face) the interactions among researchers, stakeholders, and policy makers will take place. This framework can accommodate a wide variety of research methods, and highlights exactly how participants are involved in research processes. We are prescriptive in dealing with the need to be procedurally explicit when engaging in participatory research. We anticipate that using this framework will lead to more thoughtful acceptances or refusals to participate in proposed research processes. Our framework is based on various experiences with participatory research. It is intended to be used from the very beginning of a participatory research process as a conceptual guide for researchers. We suggest a protocol to transform it into more practical guidelines for communicating about upcoming participatory research processes. The leader of such processes should propose at each key stage an explicit, yet adaptive, plan for the following stages. This plan should also specify in what ways participants will be involved, and how the plan itself can be questioned and revised.},

Alors que le travailleur à domicile classique fabriquait des produits pour s'assurer un minimum de biens de consommation et de loisirs, celui d'aujourd'hui consomme au cours de ses loisirs un maximum de produits pour, ce faisant, collaborer à la production des hommes de masse. Le processus tourne même résolument au paradoxe puisque le travailleur à domicile, au lieu d'être rémunéré pour sa collaboration, doit au contraire lui-même la payer, c'est-à-dire payer les moyens de production dont l'usage fait de lui un homme de masse (l'appareil et, le cas échéant, dans de nombreux pays, les émissions elles-mêmes). Il paie donc pour se vendre. Sa propre servitude, celle-là même qu'il contribue à produire, il doit l'acquérir en l'achetant puisqu'elle est, elle aussi, devenue une marchandise.

This posture is based on a cycling approach, in interaction with field processes, including discussion of assumptions and feedbacks on the field process. Confrontation between field and modelling processes has to be permanent because of openness and uncertainty features of these systems.

This approach is used with two possible aims: learn on systems or support collective decision processes in these systems, which corresponds to an objective of increasing knowledge either for the scientist or the field actors, always through an interaction between them mediated by an evolutionary model. Both aims lead to different implementations of this companion modelling approach, but each one is side effect of the other one, and has to be taken in account as such. Scientists ready to work in that way and make this posture alive are kindly invited to join.},

Sen explains how in a world of unprecedented increase in overall opulence, millions of people living in rich and poor countries are still unfree. Even if they are not technically slaves, they are denied elementary freedom and remain imprisoned in one way or another by economic poverty, social deprivation, political tyranny or cultural authoritarianism. The main purpose of development is to spread freedom and its 'thousand charms' to the unfree citizens. Freedom, Sen persuasively argues, is at once the ultimate goal of social and economic arrangements and the most efficient means of realizing general welfare. Social institutions like markets, political parties, legislatures, the judiciary, and the media contribute to development by enhancing individual freedom and are in turn sustained by social values. Values, institutions, development, and freedom are all closely interrelated, and Sen links them together in an elegant analytical framework. By asking "What is the relation between our collective economic wealth and our individual ability to live as we would like?" and by incorporating individual freedom as a social commitment into his analysis, Sen allows economics once again, as it did in the time of Adam Smith, to address the social basis of individual well-being and freedom.},

En reprenant la métaphore de la caverne, il s’agit ici de montrer que le chercheur en sciences sociales n’est ni au-dehors dans une hautaine radicalité ni au-dedans au risque d’une compréhension complaisante, mais sur le seuil, là où il est tenu de faire des allers et retours entre le dehors et le dedans. À partir d’une étude de cas sur le monde humanitaire dans le conflit israélo-palestinien, une esquisse est proposée de ce que pourrait être une pensée critique à la fois respectueuse de l’intelligence sociale des agents et exigeante sur la liberté intellectuelle du chercheur.},

	abstract = {There is consensus in the field of sustainability science that co-production of knowledge is needed to generate knowledge that is useful for addressing matters of concern. The field has made important advances, particularly focusing on developing strategies and principles that ensure the effective co-production of knowledge. Although these lay necessary foundations, less attention has been paid to the question as to what exactly is meant to “happen” in such processes. What is meant to happen, we argue, is that such processes generate knowledge that affects, by which we mean that it triggers an experiential intensity. Although affect ultimately underlies all kinds of knowledge (e.g., representational, such as discourse, or embodied, such as habits), different kinds and contents of knowledge affect (or not) participants of co-production processes in different ways. This paper thus argues that paying attention to affect in knowledge co-production increases the likelihood that it will be acted upon. To illustrate this point, we conceptualize knowledge as an assemblage generated through processes of knowledge co-production. We argue that for knowledge to affect, it must align the different kinds of knowledge mobilized in the process with the concrete experiences of those meant to act on it. In this paper, we particularly focus on the representational, discursive kind of knowledge, often of scientific nature, which continues to dominate processes of knowledge co-production, and explore alignment dynamics with the affective. In particular, we argue that applying methods and techniques that give room to the multimodal and multisensory nature of affect in co-production processes can support such alignment. We argue that the picture of knowledge co-production that emerges from our work as a potentially open-ended process of assembling is adequate for engaging with complex sustainability concerns in a world in constant becoming.},

	abstract = {Le positionnement des chercheurs et des praticiens de la participation a fait l’objet de nombreuses analyses soulignant la pluralité et la complémentarité des postures adoptées notamment vis-à-vis des jeux de pouvoir. Cet article insiste sur l’aspect dynamique des postures de deux « chercheurs-engagés » ayant piloté un projet de recherche pour le développement, en appui à la politique de gestion intégrée des ressources en eau ({GIRE}) au Burkina Faso. Définissant l’engagement comme un positionnement à l’interface entre le politique et le scientifique, les chercheurs ont, dès la formulation du projet, explicité leur objectif de favoriser la participation dans l’application de la {GIRE} et d’utiliser une approche participative pour ce faire. Adoptant initialement une posture de « neutralité dialogique conditionnelle », à des fins de légitimation vis-à-vis des décideurs politiques burkinabè et de pérennisation de leurs résultats de recherche, les chercheurs ont construit le projet avec ces derniers dans le cadre d’une démarche de modélisation d’accompagnement. Face aux forts différentiels de pouvoir dans la situation d’action, bloquant toute contribution des acteurs locaux à la prise de décision sur l’eau, les chercheurs ont glissé vers une posture de « non-neutralité post-normale » : l’objectif premier a alors été de renforcer la place et le rôle des acteurs locaux dans les dispositifs participatifs afin qu’ils se réapproprient les arènes de concertation créées par le législateur. Les évolutions de postures s’expliquent à la fois par les changements observés dans la situation d’action, la compréhension que les chercheurs en ont et la volonté de préserver leur éthique d’intervention. Si, d’un point de vue heuristique, l’engagement du chercheur pour la participation dans la gestion des ressources naturelles permet de nourrir une réflexion critique sur l’action publique, il est difficile d’adopter cette posture dans le cadre de projets de recherche pour le développement et dans un contexte fortement structuré par l’aide publique au développement.},

Hence, the unit of analysis is widened from sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems. The second contribution is to suggest an analytical distinction between systems, actors involved in them, and the institutions which guide actor’s perceptions and activities. Thirdly, the article opens up the black box of institutions, making them an integral part of the analysis. Institutions should not just be used to explain inertia and stability. They can also be used to conceptualise the dynamic interplay between actors and structures. The fourth contribution is to address issues of change from one system to another. The article provides a coherent conceptual multi-level perspective, using insights from sociology, institutional theory and innovation studies. The perspective is particularly useful to analyse long-term dynamics, shifts from one socio-technical system to another and the co-evolution of technology and society.},

Drawing on the Multi-Level Perspective, it develops a whole system reconfiguration approach that explains how the incorporation of multiple innovations can cumulatively reconfigure existing systems. The book focuses on {UK} electricity, heat, and mobility systems, and it systematically analyses interactions between radical niche-innovations and existing (sub)systems across techno-economic, policy, and actor dimensions in the past three decades. Comparative analysis explains why the unfolding low-carbon transitions in these three systems vary in speed, scope, and depth. It evaluates to what degree these transitions qualify as Great Reconfigurations and assesses the future potential for, and barriers to, deeper low-carbon system transitions. Generalising across these systems, broader lessons are developed about the roles of incumbent firms, governance and politics, user engagement, wider public, and civil society organisations.

	abstract = {The contribution makes use of a sociotechnical imaginaries ({STI}) framework to expose crucial but neglected governance issues in sociotechnical areas of key relevance to sustainability transformations such as energy systems. It explores how the {STI} concept can contribute to understanding transformations to sustainability (T2S) by illustrating their multidimensionality and temporality. It takes as its starting point a ‘co-productionist’ view illuminating how collective visions of desirable (or resisted) environmental futures limit or enable political imagination and the search for alternative transformative practices. It demonstrates how a focus on imaginaries can help reveal the complex multidimensionality of human needs, expectations, and uses of natural resources — and associated societal phenomena to enable T2S. By more explicitly addressing the technical as well as political and normative dimensions of T2S, this approach helps uncover the taken-for-granted assumptions that often shut down potentially promising imaginations, as well as makes visible alternate pathways and possible constitutional relationships in the triad of state and society.},

Any such instrumental function should be carried out consistently with {STS}’s interpretive and normative obligations as a social science discipline. This article illustrates how such threefold integration can be achieved by reviewing current {US} participatory politics against a 70-year backdrop of tacit constitutional developments in governing science and technology. Two broad cycles of constitutional adjustment are discerned: the first enlarging the scope of state action as well as public participation, with liberalized rules of access and sympathetic judicial review; the second cutting back on the role of the state, fostering the rise of an academic-industrial complex for technology transfer, and privatizing value debates through increasing delegation to professional ethicists. New rules for public engagement in the United Sates should take account of these historical developments and seek to counteract some of the anti-democratic tendencies observable in recent decades.},

	shorttitle = {Uncertain Futures},
	abstract = {Uncertain Futures considers how economic actors visualize the future and decide how to act in conditions of radical uncertainty. It starts from the premise that since dynamic capitalist economies are characterized by relentless innovation and novelty, they exhibit an indeterminacy that cannot be reduced to measurable risk. The organizing question then becomes how economic actors form expectations and make decisions despite the uncertainty they face. The current microfoundations of standard economics cannot handle genuinely uncertain futures. Instead, uncertainty requires an entirely new model of economic reasoning. This edited volume helps lay foundations for this new model by showing how economic actors in practice form expectations in conditions of uncertainty. It draws on groundbreaking research in economic sociology, economics, anthropology, and psychology to present theoretically grounded empirical case studies that demonstrate the role of imaginaries, narratives, and calculative technologies—and their various combinations—in enabling economic actors to form expectations and cope with uncertain futures. The book examines risk management techniques, finance models, and discounted cash-flow models as well as methods of envisaging the future that overtly combine calculation with narrative structure and imaginaries. These include central bank forward guidance, economic forecasts, business plans, visions of technological futures, and new era stories. Considerable attention is given to how these fictional expectations influence actors’ behaviour, coordinate action, and provide the confidence to act, and how they become instruments of power in markets and societies. The market impact of shared calculative devices, social narratives, and contingent imaginaries underlines the rationale for a new form of narrative economics.},

The multi-level perspective has made the notion of alignment one of the pillars of its analytical framework, but its definition remains rather vague. Using a case study of the development of biological alternatives to agricultural pesticides in Brazil, we show that alignments are based on pairings between entities of the same nature, positioned in the niche and in the regime. The strength of these pairings relies on the coherence of the new sets formed. Several types of entities need to be matched to enable alignments. In this case study, we identify three types of paired entities: technologies, users and their interests, public and private organizations. Understanding these alignment mechanisms is an invitation to deepen the analysis of the relationships between incumbent and alternative technologies in sociotechnical transitions.},

	abstract = {The past two decades have seen an accumulation of theoretical and empirical evidence for the interlinkages between human health and well-being, biodiversity and ecosystem services, and agriculture. The {COVID}-19 pandemic has highlighted the devastating impacts that an emerging pathogen, of animal origin, can have on human societies and economies. A number of scholars have called for the wider adoption of «One Health integrated approaches» to better prevent, and respond to, the threats of emerging zoonotic diseases. However, there are theoretical and practical challenges that have precluded the full development and practical implementation of this approach. Whilst integrated approaches to health are increasingly adopting a social-ecological system framework ({SES}), the lack of clarity in framing the key concept of resilience in health contexts remains a major barrier to its implementation by scientists and practitioners. We propose an operational framework, based on a trans-disciplinary definition of Socio-Ecological System Health ({SESH}) that explicitly links health and ecosystem management with the resilience of {SES}, and the adaptive capacity of the actors and agents within {SES}, to prevent and cope with emerging health and environmental risks. We focus on agricultural transitions that play a critical role in disease emergence and biodiversity conservation, to illustrate the proposed participatory framework to frame and co-design {SESH} interventions. Finally, we highlight critical changes that are needed from researchers, policy makers and donors, in order to engage communities and other stakeholders involved in the management of their own health and that of the underpinning ecosystems.},

	abstract = {One Health ({OH}), {EcoHealth} ({EH}) and Planetary Health ({PH}) share an interest in transdisciplinary efforts that bring together scientists, citizens, government and private sectors to implement contextualized actions that promote adaptive health management across human, animal and ecosystem interfaces. A key operational element underlying these Integrated Approaches to Health ({IAH}) is use of Systems Thinking as a set of tools for integration. In this paper we discuss the origins and epistemology of systems thinking and argue that participatory modelling, informed by both systems theory and expertise in facilitating engagement and social learning, can help ground {IAH} theoretically and support its development. Participatory modelling is iterative and adaptive, which is necessary to deal with complexity in practice. Participatory modelling ({PM}) methods actively involve affected interests and stakeholders to ground the field of inquiry in a specific social-ecological context. Furthermore, {PM} processes act to reconcile the diverse understandings of the empirical world that stem from divergent discipline and community viewpoints.In this perspective article, we argue that {PM} can support systems thinking in practice and is essential for {IAH} implementation. Accordingly we invite {PH}, {OH} and {EH} practitioners to systematically incorporate specialists in systems science and social engagement and facilitation. This will enable the appropriate contextualization of research practice and interventions, and ensure a balanced representation of the roles and relationships of medical, biological, mathematical, and social disciplines. For completeness, funding schemes supporting {IAH} need to follow the same iterative, adaptive and participative processes to accompany {IAH} projects throughout their implementation.},
